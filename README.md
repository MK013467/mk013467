### Hi there ðŸ‘‹I'm Minseok Kwon

 Hi, I'm Minseok Kwon from South Korea. Currently, I study physics and math-cse in UCSD. I started to code and become passionate after I discovered that I can apply the same thinking process I used in physics and math and doing exiting things through programming. I'm interested in machine learning and also working on backend serverside technology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Deep learning, Neuron modelling
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...I speak 5 languages(Korean, English, French, Chinese, German). Frankly, only 3 of them are good :D.
